# Income Prediction & Policy Segmentation

This project predicts income levels using U.S. Census data and explores socio-economic factors influencing income.  
It applies supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to classify income groups and identify data-driven policy insights.

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Means
- Model evaluation and comparison using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Files
- `eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis  
- `log-regression.ipynb`: Logistic Regression model  
- `random-forrest.ipynb`: Random Forest model  
- `xgboost.ipynb`: XGBoost model  
- `model-comp.ipynb`: Model comparison and results  
- `income_evaluation_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned U.S. Census dataset

## Dataset
U.S. Census "Adult Income" dataset (cleaned version).  
Used for educational purposes to explore income prediction modeling.
